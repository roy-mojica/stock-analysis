## Summary

Using refactored code allowed for the macros to run more efficiently. I was able to have the marco run, select the year, do the anlaysis, and format the output all in one macro. I was also able to build the code faster than trying to rewrite it from scratch. The biggest disadvantage is knowing when to change what was a varilble to an output array. I found that when the code is being refactored, I had to force the code to stop at cetain points to see where the code would error out.
